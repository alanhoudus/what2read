## What is it ? üôã

What2Read is a web application that allow users to look for new books to read, check reviews associated to those books without any notation, so to not be influenced by any number. We've made this decision, so that the user will look for books using the help of other users' opinions on the books, instead of rushing through the notations without reading any human review.

## What can you do ? üë®‚Äçüíª

### Unlogged user ‚ùå
- Without being connected the user can, on the homepage, look for the suggested book of the day, and read three randomly selected reviews using a carrousel.
